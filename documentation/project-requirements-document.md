# Project Requirements Document (PRD) - SafeTrunk

## 1. Project Overview

SafeTrunk is a command-line tool built to improve the trunk development workflow by automating quality checks before and after pushing code to the main branch. Its purpose is to ensure that every push meets predefined quality standards, reducing production errors and providing helpful feedback to developers. With SafeTrunk, individual developers and small teams can work more confidently on the main branch by having automated verifications, clear visual feedback, and flexible configuration options that suit various project needs.

The project is being built to streamline development practices and enforce code quality without slowing down the developer's productivity. Key objectives include facilitating development directly on main/trunk, automating pre-push checks and post-push actions, providing immediate feedback on code quality and impact, creating a safer and more reliable development experience, and offering a highly configurable and extensible system.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

- **Pre-Push Checks Management:**
  - Configurable execution of verification scripts in sequence with clear visual progress indicators.
  - Intelligent output management that hides detailed output unless a step fails.
  - Branch-specific configuration of which steps run on which branches.
- **Post-Push Actions:**
  - Execution of user-configured tasks after a successful push that are configurable per branch.
  - Visual progress reporting for post-push actions.
- **Remote Repository Synchronization:**
  - Verification of remote changes before starting checks.
  - Configurable automatic pull before checks.
  - Abort process when merge conflicts are detected.
- **Feedback and Analysis:**
  - Clear execution summary after completion.
  - Analysis of change complexity and basic statistics (modified files, lines added/deleted).
  - Contextual suggestions based on change analysis.
  - Gamification system to incentivize good practices.
- **Git Hooks Integration:**
  - Execution from git pre-push hook.
  - Proper exit codes for git hook integration.
- **Optional Persistence System:**
  - Storage of basic usage statistics for gamification features.
  - Achievement and level system based on usage history.
  - Option to completely disable persistence.

### Out-of-Scope

- Complex code analysis that is already available in specialized tools.
- Implementation of feature flags functionality.
- Replacement for specialized code quality tools.
- Comprehensive development analytics system (persistence is local and limited).
- Automatic resolution of merge conflicts (manual intervention is required).

## 3. User Flow

When a user attempts to push changes to the main branch, SafeTrunk is triggered via the git pre-push hook. The tool first checks for a configuration file (safetrunk.config.js, safetrunk.config.ts, or safetrunk.config.json) in the project root and loads the settings. If configured to do so, it checks for remote changes and performs a pull to integrate them, aborting if merge conflicts are detected.

The tool then proceeds with the pre-push checks, executing each configured step in sequence (or in parallel when specified) while showing visual progress indicators. For each step, detailed output is hidden by default unless the step fails. If any check fails, the complete output of the failed step is displayed, and the push is aborted with an appropriate error message.

If all checks pass, the push is allowed to proceed. After a successful push, any configured post-push actions are executed with progress indicators. Finally, the tool provides a summary of the execution, including statistics about the changes, complexity analysis, and contextual suggestions. If gamification is enabled, achievements and level information are also displayed.
