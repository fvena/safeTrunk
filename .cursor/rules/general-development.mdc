# General Development Guidelines

Guidelines for project structure, workflow, and general development practices.

## Project Structure

- Keep source in `src/`, tests in `test/` (pattern `*.test.ts`)
- Use `playground/` for development testing and `docs/` for documentation
- Don't create configuration files at root level without explicit request

## Development Workflow

- Use codebase_search to understand existing structures before making changes
- Make incremental changes that are easy to review
- Keep pull requests focused on a single concern
- Test changes locally before submitting

## Git and CI

- Don't modify GitHub workflow files unless explicitly requested
- Follow conventional commits pattern (feat:, fix:, etc.)
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the change
- Don't disable or skip established CI checks
- Preserve the Husky git hooks configuration

## Versioning

- Let semantic-release handle version updates
- Use appropriate commit types for versioning:
  - `fix:` for patch (0.0.x)
  - `feat:` for minor (0.x.0)
  - `feat:` with breaking change for major (x.0.0)
- Don't manually update version numbers in package.json

## Auth0 Development

- Always use the official Auth0 SPA SDK
- Never store sensitive auth data in localStorage
- Use Auth0's built-in methods for authentication
- Handle authentication state and error handling properly
- Use environment variables for Auth0 configuration

## Collaboration

- Respect existing code styles and patterns
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Document design decisions for complex features
- Keep discussions focused on code, not preferences
- Be mindful of dependencies and their impact
